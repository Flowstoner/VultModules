            This is a set of modules that have been carefully designed to fit the Eurorack style of VCV Rack. The modules are coded in
            the Vult programming language.
         </p>
         <p>
            The Vult modules are "Virtual Analog". The internals of the modules are modeled using electrical circuits and differential
            equations, but some behaviors have been simplified when they are easy to do in code. These modules are not emulations
            of an specific Eurorack module. In the case of the filters the modules try to capture the essence and the sound
            of the analog versions, and at the same time provide very good performance. Some of the modules, like Trummor
            2, were inspired by existing hardware but have evolved into complete original designs.

         <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

         <p>
            When designing these modules I have established the following rules:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>it should look like a real Eurorack module</li>
            <li>the interaction has to be limited to real hardware components (knobs, switches, etc.)</li>
            <li>if I cannot build the real hardware, I will not build the software</li>
            <li>and of course, the module needs to sound good</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Following these rules helps me constrain the ideas for modules I have. But I may break them in the future.</p>
