Spank is the envelope generator in charge of producing the snappy sounds of Trummor and Trummor 2. All transitions are exponential since they are modeled after the behavior of a charging capacitor.

The module provides three operating modes: Slow, Fast and Loop. In slow mode the envelope provides good time constants to use with sound sources. Fast mode is good for drum sounds. Loop mode is a special mode that sends multiple pulses during the hold time. Loop mode is useful for making snare-like sounds or as a crazy oscillator.

The module includes a VCA so you can use it directly to control an input source.
