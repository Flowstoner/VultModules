Trummor is a drum synthesizer that produces 909 style kicks. Trummor can be used to produce other type of percusive sounds like toms and simple snares or hats.

I started developing the algorithms behind Trummor along time ago and I made a simplified [hardware version](http://modlfo.github.io/projects/vult-analog-module/) of it. When VCV Rack came out, I adapted the code and started expanding the sonic capabilities.

Trummor has been replaced by Trummor 2 which is an improved version with even more sonic capabilities.
