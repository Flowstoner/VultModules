Julste is the only model that I haven't developed by myself. When I started doing research on low pass gates I came across the paper "A DIGITAL MODEL OF THE BUCHLA LOWPASS-GATE" by Julian Parker and Stefano Dâ€™Angelo. They did all the hard job modeling it, I just rewrote the code in the Vult language and created the module.

The result is a really nice sounding low pass gate. But that's not all... I'm working on an update trying to give it my personal touch.
