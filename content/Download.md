Iâ€™m glad to publish these modules for free so anyone can use them ([why free?](/about)). But these modules don't come cheap for me. Behind every module there are many hours of work (and many litters of coffee). If you enjoy these modules you can support the development by making a donation.

The suggested donation is 20 euro for the full pack, but of course you can donate as much as you want any donation help me buy more coffeeeeee :)

You can get binaries for Linux, Windows and Mac.
