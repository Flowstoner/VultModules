The Vult modules are designed by me [Leonardo Laguna Ruiz](http://modlfo.github.io). I create all these modules during my free time, driven by the passion I have for music, synthesizers, electronics and  technology.

If you want to know more, you can find an interview with me here:[ Switched On Rack: Meet the Devs](http://www.switchedonrack.com/meet-the-devs-vult.html)

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/modlfo) or hanging around the [VCV Rack Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vcvrack/). You can also contact me at [modlfo@gmail.com](mailto:modlfo@gmail.com)
