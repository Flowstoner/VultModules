*This module is still in development and has not been released yet*

Vessek started modeling the basic circuit of an analog saw wave oscillator. Most of the parameters were obtained from my Volca Bass, which is the analog synth that I have on hand and I like the oscillator. I got a pretty good matching of the sound that I bet it would pass a blind test.

After some mathematical magic, I turned the model into something more efficient that still produces a very good analog sound. The new model allows me adding many more features that were not available in the original circuit.

I'm still experimenting with a long list of cool things, the final features have not been defined yet. But this oscillator will not have much to envy to hardware oscillators.

**Vessek is not a [*put-your-favorite-analog-oscillator-brand-here*], Vessek is a Vult.**

## Demo Sounds (early development)

These are some sounds produced with a single Vessek. The sounds have no variating modulation (e.g. changin PW). The later sounds were found with the random function and have a filter (Tangents).
