*This module is still in development and has not been released yet*

Vessek started modeling the basic circuit of an analog saw wave oscillator. Most of the parameters were initially obtained from my Volca Bass. I got a pretty good matching of the sound that I bet it would pass a blind test. Later in the development, samples of the Mother32, MFB Synth II and 0-Coast were sent to me by members of the VCV Rack community.

From the samples I'm able of extracting characteristics of the waves that help me fit my greybox model. Then I turned the model into something more efficient that still produces a very good analog sound. The new models allow me adding many more features that are not available in the original circuits.

The current model is a blend of the above mentioned oscillators with some added tweaks to give Vessek it's own personality.

## Demo Sounds (early development)

These are some sounds produced with a single Vessek (two oscillators from the version based on the Volca Bass). The sounds have no variating modulation (e.g. changin PW). The later sounds were found with the random function and have a filter (Tangents).
