Caudal is a chaotic source that is based on the model of a multi segment pendulum (see the video below). This idea came to my mind after Antonio Tuzzi (NYSTHI) posted a video of one of his modules where he was showing a visualization of the harmonics in an oscillator. To my eyes that looked like a multi segment pendulum in chaotic mode (I have worked for many years in the field of simulation). After knowing it was not what I thought I decided to make it.

The core of Caudal is a detailed simulation of the pendulum system from which we can get measurements like the angular velocities and positions of the segments. These measures produces very natural oscillations that are interrelated due to the nature of the system.

I made the original model using SystemModeler and later applied manual optimizations to improve the performance and being able of running it in real-time.
