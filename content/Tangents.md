Tangents is a filter based on the Steiner-Parker structure. This module provides separate inputs to use it as LP, BP, and HP filter. This allows you to insert different signals into the inputs and process them together.

The model has been created analyzing the Yves Usson version (YuSynth) and simplified to a point where the filter is good sounding and efficient.

This module has a long history. Some years ago I got obsessed with the Steiner-Parker filter. I found the original article of Nyle Steiner and I started making models and simulations of it. My obsession calmed a bit when I designed my own [Eurorack module](http://modlfo.github.io/projects/vult-analog-steiner-parker/), but one night I found one of the simulation models I made. Immediately I started getting the equations an trying to put them in a simplified form. After making seven models and more than 500 simulations, I got a nice set of equation that was simple enough and sounded very cool.

One big addition I made in this version compared with the hardware version is that this module leaves exposed three inputs (LP, BP and HP). This makes possible to connect three sources and affecting the frequency content for each input differently.
